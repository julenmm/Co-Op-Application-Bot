    "- Simple login (add data in txt file)\n",
    "- manual filtering of roles ( mannually apply filters before \"stop running cells\")\n",
    "- Automatic application to All filtered possition\n",
    "- Automatic resume selection\n",
    "- Automatic Transcript selection\n",
    "- Automatic Generic cover letter Selection\n",
    "- Application log creation in Xcell File at the end of the program listing sucessful and failed applications separately\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Jupyter notebooks and all requred libraries with pip install\n",

    "    * Add your Password as a string as (password = 'my password')\n",
    "    * Log in from a normal tab and in duo security verification click \"send codes\", enter codes as a list (access_codes = *****). Codes have to be formatted as strings\n",
    "4. Enter your files in Nu Works.\n",
    "    * Upload your resume and name it \"Resume\"\n",
    "    * Upload a your transcript and name it \"Transcript\"\n",

    "    - IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE NAMES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME.\n",
    "3. Congrats!!! Now you're ready to start runnning the program, apply to absolutely EVERY position you filter, and stop wasting your time.\n",
    "* Run cells by clicking shift + enter until you reach the cell that says \"Stop Running\"\n",
    "* select Your desired filters for the jobs you want to apply (manually)\n",
    "* Continue running using shift + enter\n",
    "\n",
    "4. LET THE PROGRAM RUN AND APPLY FOR YOU OVER NIGHT\n",
